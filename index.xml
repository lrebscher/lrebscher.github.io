I build and evaluated machine learning models to predict product characteristics. One of my notable achievements includes developing a multi-output neural network that was successfully deployed in production, enriching millions of products. In addition, I extended and created several streaming services (stateful and stateless) and contributed to their functionality and scalability, allowing millions of products and predictions to be processed efficiently.</description></item></channel></rss>
